## Ranking Key

Green means we recommend it for doing classical education well. They primarily use Great Books, employ Socratic dialog in class, teach history, language, humanities, and sciences as an integrated whole. 

Green means we recommend it for doing classical education well. They primarily use Great Books, employ Socratic dialog in class, teach history, language, humanities, and sciences as an integrated whole, and teach Greek and/or Latin.

Red means that we do not recommend the school for doing classical education well. They may be "classical in name only", may use textbooks only, may use lecture only, may not teach Greek or Latin, and divide up subjects into isolated and units exactly the way that most public and most private schools have done for the last 60 years. 

White means we have no personal knowledge of the school and that 
research is ongoing. 

Yellow means that we have received mixed reports.

## Criteria

Judgments are based on personal acquaintance with the school or well-researched reports.  

## Contribute

We welcome well-reasoned, well-researched reviews of these schools by those personally acquainted with them -- such as administrators, teachers, parents, current or former students. [Send us an email.](emailto:info@buhlerreport.com)
