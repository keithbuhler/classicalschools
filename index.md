## Ranking Key

1. Green means we recommend the school for doing classical education well. They primarily use Great Books, employ Socratic dialog in class, teach history, language, humanities, and sciences as an integrated whole, and teach Greek and/or Latin.
2. Yellow means that we have received mixed reports.
3. Red means that we do not recommend the school for doing classical education well. They may be "classical in name only", may use textbooks only, may use lecture only, may not teach Greek or Latin, and divide up subjects into isolated and units exactly the way that most public and most private schools have done for the last 60 years. 
4. White means we do not yet have reliable knowledge of the quality of the school or that research is ongoing. 


## Criteria

Judgments are based on personal acquaintance with the school or well-researched reports.  

## Contribute

1. Tell us about your school if it's not on the list. 
2. Offer updated information (website link, grade levels served, etc.)
